Hydra-PubSubByType

The Hydra-PubSubByType NuGet package gives client access to the publish/subscribe by type messaging capabilities of the Hydra platform. In order to use Hydra you must have set up at least one CouchDb server for clients to poll, following the instructions in the Hydra distribution at https://github.com/NorthNick/hydra/tree/master/CouchDb.

The Hydra wiki at https://github.com/NorthNick/hydra/wiki contains more information on using Hydra, and you may also want to get the Hydra-Conversations NuGet package to take advantage of other Hydra features.
